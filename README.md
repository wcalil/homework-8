 # Title: ReadMe Generator
                
 ## Description: "The project is a Readme generator buit with java script and run on node. The project uses 3 modules: axious (to get the Git hub API data), the FS (to build the mark down file), and the inquirer (to provide questions and store the answers using fs). The project has a call back function that waits for the inquierer module to finish loading the answers to insert the answers in the md file through the "then" method. The naswers are stored in a const named markdown and then uses fs.writefile to inser them in the md file.
 
                
 ## Development Environment: The application is built in JavaScript which runs in Node.JS instead of the brownser. To run the application the user needs to use Terminal or Bash through "node index.js" command. After that, the user will be requested to answer question whcih are topics of the readme file.
